# Data Warehouse Design for an Agricultural Enterprise

This project focuses on designing a data warehouse system for an agricultural company specializing in sheep farming and product sales. The goal is to create an efficient data model that enables comprehensive reporting and analysis of various aspects of the business, including livestock management, retail and wholesale operations, and product distribution.

Key Components:
1) Star Schema Design: The project includes multiple Star Schemas, created using Data Modeler, to support various business reports.
2) Data Granularity & Fact Table Definition: Each schema is structured to capture key business metrics, such as livestock movement, product sales, pasture utilization, and veterinary records.
3) Dimension Tables: The design incorporates dimensions like flock characteristics, shepherds, pasture conditions, product categories, customer demographics, and transaction history.
4) BUS Matrix: A BUS Matrix was developed to ensure consistency across Star Schemas and to standardize common dimensions.

Business Insights Enabled by the Data Warehouse:
1) Livestock Management: Tracking the number of sheep per farm, their movement between flocks, breeding history, and veterinary data.
2) Retail & Wholesale Analytics: Analyzing sales trends, product turnover, and customer purchasing behaviors.
3) Sheep Product Processing: Monitoring wool and milk quality, processing efficiency, and outsourcing impact.
4) Shepherd & Working Dog Performance: Evaluating shepherd efficiency based on productivity and sheep well-being.
5) Auction-Based Sales Optimization: Analyzing wholesale bidding trends, price fluctuations, and buyer behavior.

By implementing this data warehouse solution, the company gains advanced business intelligence capabilities, enabling optimized decision-making for farm operations, product distribution, and sales strategies.
